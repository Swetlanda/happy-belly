# UX
## Database planning

In the project, I used the Django AllAuth User Model and custom made models:

**Django AllAuth User Model:**

|       Name        |        Type         |  Key  |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------|
| `id`              | AutoField           |  PK   |
| `username`        | CharField           |       |
| `email`           | EmailField          |       |
| `password`        | CharField           |       |

**Custom-made Recipe Model:**

|       Name       |         Type         |  Key  |
|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `title`          | CharField            |       |
| `user`           | User Model           |  FK   |
| `slug`           | SlugField            |       |
| `description`    | TextField            |       |
| `ingredients`    | TextField            |       |
| `instructions`   | TextField            |       |
| `tag`            | TaggableManager      |       |
| `status`         | IntegerField         |       |
| `image`          | CloudinaryField      |       |
| `image_alt`      | CharField            |       |
| `serving`        | IntegerField         |       |
| `created_on`     | DateTimeField        |       |
| `updated_on`     | DateTimeField        |       |

Additional model features:
- User relationship: Each recipe is linked to the user who created it via a foreign key.
- Null handling: If a user or recipe is deleted, the corresponding favorite entry is set to NULL rather than being deleted.
- Slug generation: Slugs are automatically generated from the title and are ensured to be unique using a method "generate_unique_slug". Also a method "populate_slug" is used to automatically populate the slug field before saving.
- Status field: Controls recipe visibility with 2 status - Draft and Published.
- Image management: Recipes can include images managed by Cloudinary. 
- Tags: TaggableManager enables flexible tagging for categorising recipes.
- Ordering: Recipes are displayed in descending order.

**Custom-made Favorite Model**

|       Name       |         Type         |  Key  |
|------------------|----------------------|-------|
| `user`           | ForeignKey (User)    |  FK   |
| `recipe`         | ForeignKey (Recipe)  |  FK   |


Additional model features:
- User relationship: Connects users to their favorite recipes via foreign keys.	
- Unique constraint: Ensures a user can favorite a recipe only once.
- Null handling: If a user or recipe is deleted, the corresponding favorite entry is set to NULL rather than being deleted.

## Design

### Wireframes
The Happy Belly recipes website is designed with Bootstrap to allow for responsivness so can be easily used on mobile, tablet and desktop devices.

I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes. They were served as initial thnking and evolved during the build in line with Agile methodology.

### Features
- Recipe listing:
	- Recipes are displayed as cards with an image, title, description, tags, user and posting date.
	- Recipe listings are paginated by 8 to improve loading times and user experience, with navigation controls for easy browsing.
	- Each recipe card is clickable, leading to a full detailed view of the recipe.
	
Welcome page

- Search:
	- Users can search for recipes by title, description, ingredients, or tags.
